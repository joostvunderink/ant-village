Bot/simulation framework for the card game Dominion.

The framework consists of two part:

  * Game simulation
  * Game strategy evolution

The game simulation allows strategies to compete in a single game of Dominion. All rules of Dominion are followed. The number of implemented cards is limited, but will increase with work.

The strategy evolution framework consists of running multiple generations of bots against each other and evolve their genes.


The ant-village project is a follow up of the Dominator project by Garion and Verik. See http://simulatedominion.wordpress.com/ for info.
